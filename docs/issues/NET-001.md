## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows LoadBalancer service has no external IP assigned

## Resolution

1. Ensure the cluster has the cloud provider LoadBalancer provisioner (e.g. CCM) installed and configured
2. Check controller and node logs for quota, network, or permission issues
3. On bare metal or on-prem, deploy MetalLB or similar for LoadBalancer
4. As a workaround use NodePort or Ingress to expose the service

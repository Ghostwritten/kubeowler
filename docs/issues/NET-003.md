# NET-003 Service has no selector or endpoints

## Summary

A Service has no selector or endpoints when it does not set a selector (and is not headless) or has no matching Endpoints. Traffic to the Service may not be forwarded to backend pods.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Service &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;name&gt; has no selector and may not have endpoints
- Service spec.selector is empty and clusterIP is not None

## Resolution

1. Set spec.selector on the Service to match target pods
2. Or use a headless Service (clusterIP: None) with custom Endpoints/EndpointSlice
3. Verify Endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints <ns>/<svc>` and confirm addresses exist

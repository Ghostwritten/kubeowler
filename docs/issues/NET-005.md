# NET-005 DNS service not found

## Summary

The cluster DNS Service (e.g. kube-dns in kube-system) was not found. Without it, in-cluster DNS resolution fails and workloads may not resolve Service or Pod DNS names.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: DNS service not found
- No Service named kube-dns (or configured DNS service) in kube-system

## Resolution

1. Verify DNS add-on is installed (e.g. CoreDNS or kube-dns per distribution)
2. Deploy cluster DNS if missing; follow your distribution's or [CoreDNS deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns/) instructions
3. Ensure the DNS Service and Endpoints exist and are used by kubelet DNS config

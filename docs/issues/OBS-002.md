# OBS-002 kube-state-metrics not deployed

## Summary

Without kube-state-metrics, Prometheus and similar systems cannot collect metrics keyed by Kubernetes objects (e.g. Deployment desired/current replicas, Pod status). This limits alerting and dashboards.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows kube-state-metrics is missing or not ready
- No kube-state-metrics pods Ready in the cluster

## Resolution

1. Deploy kube-state-metrics using the official manifest or Helm chart; configure RBAC
2. Ensure Prometheus can scrape its metrics endpoint; add ServiceMonitor or scrape_config as needed
3. Verify metrics include deployment, pod, node dimensions

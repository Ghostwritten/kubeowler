# OBS-003 Log aggregation not deployed

## Summary

Without a log aggregation component (e.g. Fluentd, Vector, Logstash, Loki), centralized log collection and querying are unavailable, which hinders troubleshooting and audit.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows no logging collector pods detected
- No common log collector pods (e.g. fluent, vector, logstash, loki) in target namespaces

## Resolution

1. Choose and deploy a logging stack: Fluent Bit + Loki, EFK, Vector, etc.
2. Configure collection of pod logs (e.g. mount /var/log/pods), filtering, and output (object storage, Elasticsearch, Loki)
3. Ensure RBAC, resources, and storage meet collection and retention needs

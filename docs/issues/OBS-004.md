# OBS-004 Prometheus/monitoring not deployed

## Summary

When no Prometheus or compatible monitoring (e.g. Thanos, VictoriaMetrics) is detected, the cluster lacks metric storage and alerting, which hinders capacity planning and incident detection.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows no Prometheus-compatible monitoring found
- No Prometheus/Thanos/VictoriaMetrics pods Ready in common monitoring namespaces

## Resolution

1. Deploy Prometheus or a compatible stack (Thanos, VictoriaMetrics) with persistence and HA as needed
2. Configure scraping of metrics-server, kube-state-metrics, node and component metrics; configure Alertmanager and alert rules
3. Integrate with Grafana or similar for cluster and application dashboards
4. If using cloud-managed monitoring, integrate the provider's agent or exporter

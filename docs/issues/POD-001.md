# POD-001 Pod in Failed state

## Summary

A pod is in Failed state when its phase is Failed, usually due to a container exiting with a non-zero code or exceeding retry limits. Root cause should be fixed to avoid downtime or repeated failures.

## Severity

Critical

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;name&gt; is in Failed state
- `kubectl get pods` shows STATUS Failed for the pod

## Resolution

1. Inspect pod details and events: `kubectl describe pod <ns>/<name>`
2. Check container logs: `kubectl logs <ns>/<name> -c <container> --previous` (if restarted)
3. Use exit code and events to distinguish: image pull failure, startup probe failure, OOM, application error, etc.
4. Fix image, resource limits, probes, or application logic and redeploy

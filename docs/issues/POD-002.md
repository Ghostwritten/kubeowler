# POD-002 Pod cannot be scheduled

## Summary

A pod cannot be scheduled when it remains Pending with condition PodScheduled False. Common causes include insufficient resources, affinity/anti-affinity, taints, or unbound PVCs preventing the scheduler from placing the pod.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;name&gt; cannot be scheduled
- Pod is Pending; `kubectl describe pod` shows scheduling failure reason in Events

## Resolution

1. Run `kubectl describe pod <ns>/<name>` and check Events for the scheduling failure reason
2. If resources: add nodes or lower pod requests; check ResourceQuota and LimitRange
3. If taints/affinity: adjust pod tolerations or node affinity
4. If PVC unbound: ensure StorageClass and PV are available, or fix PVC spec

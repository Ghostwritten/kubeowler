# POD-004 Container in abnormal state

## Summary

A container is reported in an abnormal state when its status is Waiting (e.g. ImagePullBackOff, CrashLoopBackOff, ContainerCreating) or Terminated with a non-zero exit code or error reason. The report includes the exact reason from the API so you can target fixes.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod has container in state with a reason (e.g. ImagePullBackOff, ErrImagePull, CrashLoopBackOff)
- `kubectl describe pod` shows container state Waiting or Terminated with a reason/message

## Resolution

1. Inspect pod and events: `kubectl describe pod <ns>/<name>`
2. For **ImagePullBackOff** / **ErrImagePull**: fix image name, tag, or pull secrets; check network and registry access
3. For **CrashLoopBackOff**: check logs and previous logs; fix application, probes, or resources
4. For **ContainerCreating**: usually transient; if it persists, check volume mounts, secrets, or node resources
5. For **Terminated** with non-zero exit code: use exit code and message to fix the application or configuration

# POD-005 ImagePullBackOff

## Summary

The container image could not be pulled. Kubernetes retries with backoff; the pod stays in Waiting state with reason ImagePullBackOff until the image is available or the pull succeeds.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod has container in state **ImagePullBackOff**
- `kubectl describe pod` shows state.waiting.reason: ImagePullBackOff and often a message from the previous ErrImagePull attempt

## Resolution

1. Check image name and tag with kubectl get pod
2. Verify image exists in the registry and the tag is correct
3. If using a private registry, ensure imagePullSecrets are set and valid
4. Check node network and DNS; ensure the node can reach the registry
5. Run kubectl describe pod and check Events for the exact error

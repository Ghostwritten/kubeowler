# POD-007 CrashLoopBackOff

## Summary

The container starts, then exits (often with a non-zero exit code). The kubelet restarts it with exponential backoff. Common causes include application errors, failed probes, OOM, or missing config.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod has container in state **CrashLoopBackOff**
- kubectl get pods shows Restarts increasing and status CrashLoopBackOff

## Resolution

1. Check container logs: kubectl logs with --previous if needed
2. Check liveness/readiness probes and adjust thresholds or command if they fail too soon
3. Verify config maps, secrets, and env vars the container needs are present
4. If OOM suspected, increase memory limits or fix memory leaks
5. Use kubectl describe pod to see the last termination reason and exit code

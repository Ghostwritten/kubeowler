# POD-008 ContainerCreating

## Summary

The container is not yet running; the kubelet is still creating it (e.g. pulling the image, setting up volumes). This is often transient. If it persists, there may be an issue with image pull, volumes, or node resources.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod has container in state **ContainerCreating**
- kubectl describe pod shows state.waiting.reason: ContainerCreating

## Resolution

1. Wait briefly; many pods move to Running after the image is pulled and the container starts
2. If it stays in ContainerCreating, run kubectl describe pod and check Events
3. Check node disk and inodes; ensure the node has capacity for the container rootfs and volumes
4. For volume issues, verify PVCs are Bound and that secrets/configmaps exist

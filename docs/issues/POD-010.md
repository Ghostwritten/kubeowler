# POD-010 OOMKilled

## Summary

The container was terminated because it used more memory than its limit (OOM killed). The exit code is typically 137. This is reported as a terminated state with reason OOMKilled.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Container terminated with reason **OOMKilled** (or state table shows reason OOMKilled)
- `kubectl describe pod` may show lastState.terminated.reason: OOMKilled

## Resolution

1. Increase the container memory limit in the pod spec if the workload legitimately needs more memory
2. Fix memory leaks or unbounded growth in the application
3. Review usage: `kubectl top pod` (if metrics-server is available) to see current usage before OOM
4. Consider setting memory requests and limits appropriately and tuning application or JVM heap size

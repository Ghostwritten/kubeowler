# POD-011 Container terminated (non-zero exit)

## Summary

The container ran and then terminated with a non-zero exit code (or with a reason such as Error, ContainerCannotRun, or DeadlineExceeded). This indicates an application or runtime failure rather than a pull or config issue.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Container **terminated** with reason and exit_code
- `kubectl describe pod` shows state.terminated with exitCode and optional reason/message

## Resolution

1. Check logs: `kubectl logs <ns>/<name> -c <container> --previous`
2. Use the exit code and message to identify the failure (e.g. 1 = general error, 137 = OOMKilled, 143 = SIGTERM)
3. Fix the application code, startup command, or runtime config (e.g. invalid args, missing file, permission error)
4. For DeadlineExceeded, consider increasing activeDeadlineSeconds or fixing the workload so it completes in time

# POD-012 Pod Running but not Ready

## Summary

A pod is in **Running** phase but its **Ready** condition is False (e.g. `kubectl get pods` shows `0/1 Running`). The containers are up but the pod is not considered ready to receive traffic—often due to failing readiness probes, slow startup, or a stuck container.

## Severity

Critical

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;name&gt; is Running but not Ready
- `kubectl get pods` shows READY column as 0/1 (or 0/N) while STATUS is Running
- Pod may have restarts; readiness probe may be failing

## Resolution

1. Inspect pod: `kubectl describe pod <ns>/<name>` and check **Conditions** (Ready: False, reason/message).
2. Check container logs: `kubectl logs <ns>/<name> -c <container>` and `--previous` if restarted.
3. If readiness probe is configured: verify probe endpoint (HTTP path, TCP port, or exec) and thresholds; extend initialDelaySeconds or failureThreshold if the app starts slowly.
4. Fix application health endpoint, resource limits, or probe configuration and redeploy.

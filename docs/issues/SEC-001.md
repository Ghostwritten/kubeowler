# SEC-001 ClusterRole has excessive permissions

## Summary

A ClusterRole grants overly broad permissions (e.g. wildcard resources or verbs). Such roles increase blast radius if a principal or ServiceAccount is compromised.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: ClusterRole &lt;name&gt; has excessive permissions
- ClusterRole rules use * for apiGroups, resources, or verbs

## Resolution

1. Follow least privilege: restrict to specific apiGroups, resources, and verbs
2. Prefer Role for namespace-scoped access; use ClusterRole only when cluster-wide access is required
3. Audit who is bound to the role (ClusterRoleBinding/RoleBinding) and reduce scope
4. Use Pod Security and RBAC audit logs to detect misuse

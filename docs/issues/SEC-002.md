# SEC-002 User has cluster-admin

## Summary

A user or identity is bound to cluster-admin (or equivalent). Cluster-admin has full control of the cluster; such bindings should be limited and audited.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows that a user has cluster-admin
- User appears in a ClusterRoleBinding to cluster-admin (or role with equivalent privileges)

## Resolution

1. Remove cluster-admin from users who do not need cluster-wide admin
2. Create custom ClusterRoles with only the required permissions
3. Use groups and RBAC to grant minimal access per team or namespace
4. Enable audit logging and review cluster-admin usage regularly

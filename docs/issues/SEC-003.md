# SEC-003 ServiceAccount has cluster-admin

## Summary

A ServiceAccount is bound to cluster-admin (or equivalent). Workloads using this account have full cluster access; a compromise can lead to cluster takeover.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows that a ServiceAccount has cluster-admin
- ServiceAccount is subject of a ClusterRoleBinding to cluster-admin

## Resolution

1. Replace with a Role or limited ClusterRole that grants only required permissions
2. Prefer namespace-scoped Role and RoleBinding for application ServiceAccounts
3. Use dedicated ServiceAccounts per workload and avoid sharing high-privilege accounts
4. Audit which pods use the ServiceAccount and reduce scope

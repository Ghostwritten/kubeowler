# SEC-004 Pod runs as root

## Summary

A pod is configured to run as root (e.g. securityContext.runAsUser: 0). Root in the container increases risk if the container is compromised or escapes.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Pod &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;name&gt; runs as root
- Pod or container securityContext.runAsUser is 0 or unset with root default

## Resolution

1. Set securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true and runAsUser to a non-zero UID
2. Build images to run as a non-root user; avoid requiring root for application logic
3. Use Pod Security Standards/Admission to enforce runAsNonRoot
4. If root is required for legacy workloads, isolate in dedicated namespaces and restrict network

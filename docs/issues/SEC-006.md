# SEC-006 Container runs as root

## Summary

A container runs as root (runAsUser 0 or default root). Running as root inside the container increases risk on container compromise or breakout.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Container &lt;name&gt; in pod &lt;ns&gt;/&lt;pod&gt; runs as root
- Container securityContext.runAsUser is 0 or unset with root default

## Resolution

1. Set runAsNonRoot: true and runAsUser to a non-zero UID at pod or container level
2. Use images that run as non-root; avoid root for application code
3. Enforce via Pod Security admission (e.g. restricted policy)
4. For legacy workloads requiring root, isolate and restrict network and host access

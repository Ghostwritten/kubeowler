# SEC-008 Insufficient network policy coverage

## Summary

Namespaces or workloads lack NetworkPolicies, so pod-to-pod traffic is unrestricted by default. This increases lateral movement risk if a pod is compromised.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Low or insufficient network policy coverage
- Few or no NetworkPolicies apply to the namespace or workload

## Resolution

1. Add NetworkPolicies to deny by default and allow only required ingress/egress
2. Start with critical namespaces (e.g. production); allow traffic to/from known peers and DNS
3. Use labels and selectors to scope policies to specific pods
4. Test policies in non-production to avoid breaking connectivity

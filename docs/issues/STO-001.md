## Resolution

1. Inspect PV: `kubectl describe pv <name>` and check Events, Capacity, StorageClass
2. Verify backing storage: NFS path accessibility, cloud disk attachment, permissions and network

4. If unrecoverable, delete and recreate PV/PVC after backing up data and considering reclaim policy

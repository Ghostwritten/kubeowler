# STO-003 PV Retained, manual action needed

## Summary

A PV in Retained state (or Released with Retain policy) requires manual steps to reclaim or reuse. The volume is not automatically deleted or rebound.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Persistent Volume &lt;name&gt; is Retained
- PV status.phase is Retained or Released with reclaimPolicy Retain

## Resolution

1. Back up data if needed before reusing or deleting
2. To delete: remove the PV object; clean up the backing storage per provider
3. To reuse: remove claimRef from the PV so a new PVC can bind (provider-dependent)
4. Consider Delete reclaim policy for dynamically provisioned volumes if automatic cleanup is desired

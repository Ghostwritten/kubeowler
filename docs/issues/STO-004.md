# STO-004 PV has no reclaim policy

## Summary

A PV has no reclaim policy set (or uses an unexpected default). Reclaim policy determines what happens when the PVC is deleted (Retain vs Delete) and affects data safety and cleanup.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Persistent Volume &lt;name&gt; has no reclaim policy
- PV spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy is missing or invalid

## Resolution

1. Set spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy explicitly: Retain (keep volume) or Delete (delete volume when PVC is released)
2. For critical data prefer Retain; for ephemeral or dynamically provisioned storage Delete may be acceptable
3. StorageClass can set default reclaim policy for dynamic provisioning

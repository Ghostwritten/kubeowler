# STO-010 Multiple StorageClasses marked default

## Summary

More than one StorageClass is marked as default. This is ambiguous; the cluster may pick one arbitrarily and PVC behavior can be inconsistent.


## Severity

Warning

## Example

N/A

## Symptoms

- Report shows: Multiple StorageClasses marked as default
- Several StorageClasses have storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true

## Resolution

1. Keep only one default: remove the is-default-class annotation from all but one StorageClass
2. Choose the StorageClass that should serve as the default for unspecified PVCs
3. Document which class is default for your cluster
